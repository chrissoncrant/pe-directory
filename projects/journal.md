## Day 81
[Contrast](https://perpetual.education/lesson/contrast/)

### Notes on Contrast
See also [[Contrast]]

Start with the Focal Point

The eyes and attention are directed by contrast. Space creates contrast.

Do bad work to discover the good work. What doesn’t work reveals what does work. The contrast between the two reveal each other. 

Type Contrasts:
- font size
- weight
- casing (uppercase and lowercase)
- italicize

### Daily
Yesterday:
Went through the assignment, playing with space and experiencing its power to create contrast and experience. 
Made some progress on the responsive layout challenge
Met up with Derek for a couple hours; we discussed goals; he helped me start putting together a data structure for a project I am working on. Was very fun and helpful and I am grateful.

Today:
Exploring contrast; watching another analysis with Milka and Chris (I really enjoyed the one I watched a few weeks ago; I feel like I learned a lot)
Finish the responsive layout challenge and add it to my projects
Spend some time creating a plan of action for prioritizing and attacking this backlog of things that need to be done (blog/writing, portfolio/business card site which I have yet to even create, sprucing up and finalizing projects I’ve already started during this course, like the business site and others).

Feeling some overwhelm. Wishing for more consolidation days. Enthusiastic nonetheless. 

Cheers!


## Day 80
[Space!!!](https://perpetual.education/lesson/space/)


### Notes
What is space? The relationship between an object and its environment and objects with other objects. 

Space involves alignment, proximity and negative spatial shapes. 

Space directs attention.

Space creates contrast. Contrasting with color, size, style, font. Bringing qualities nearer to or farther from one another generates emergent properties. Hidden and secret qualities get revealed in the juxtaposition.

These emergent properties have psychological impacts: excitement, fear, boredom, interest, aggression, calmness.

These properties also guide attention

Space and proximity reveal relationships.

Qualities that depend on one another for their quality to have meaning:
High - low
Big - small
Loud - quiet
Bright - dim
Full - empty
Hard - soft
Order - chaos
Color - grayscale
Rough - smooth
Close - far
Normal - strange
Round - sharp
Closed - open
Tension - release
Symmetry - asymmetry
Connected - disconnected
Focus - blur

#### Notes from 2nd video
Being thoughtful with how one spaces text. Even if it’s randomly placed, what is driving the placement? How can that placement be unified across the project?

Learning to pay attention to the space, not the content.

—————
The first challenge seems to be bringing things in our visual inspiration folder near one another

The second challenge:
- create a simple website layout
- create some components paying attention to size

### Tasks:
Go to the mood boards and find contrasting items and group these together in interesting ways. Make at least 3 groupings and write out a brief explanation on what decisions were made in choosing each of the groupings. 
Find 3 components and analyze them for space; create these in Affinity designer and make one iteration on each. Perhaps one iteration for mobile screen and one for desktop
Code these out. 

### Daily
Yesterday:
Did some more component analysis in the morning
Got caught up on the assignments; made mood boards; created some black and white and grayscale graphics.
Got started on another responsive challenge (this one). https://perpetual.education/exercise/responsive-layout-challenge-variations/ 

Today:
Meeting up with Derek
Working on today’s assignment
Spend some time with what I have so much resistance to doing, for whatever reason: planning out my public facing site and writing and thinking about my goals. I do have some written out already, but I want to see if I can flesh them out some more, and then start thinking about how to lay them out on a simple site. 
Make some more components. (I am finding this site is awesome for discovering components; I am thinking about doing a daily challenge where I just go through and pick one component to make, then add it to the  Magical Garden of Responsive Layouts and Components. Cue butterflies, sunshine, mist from waterfall and rainbow)

Cheers!
