		- **playful**
		- **generous**
		- **humble**
		- **Trusting** one’s self and one’s **intuition**
		- **breaking** a standard/mold. It creates/**builds** something new that serves the purpose of something old in a more efficient and/or effective way. 
		- Flipping old paradigms on their head
		- Staying stupid; not trying to be smart, but rather following one’s **curiosity** to work its magic. 
		- Paying **attention** and being **sensitive** to perspectives that have gone unattended.  
		- david and goliath
		- juxtaposition
		- moving against the grain
		- Gettin images in my head of **upward growth**, but also a **cyclical process of renewal**; shattering the old and rigid and using the parts to build something new. Taking what has been and creating a new from it.
		- Phoenix 
		- Questioning standards; poking and prodding
- look at images that might convey the words meaning and collect them into the inspiration artboard

## Explore Phase
- draw out some ideas either with the iPad or in AD
- 


## What I did
### Research phase
- 10 mins looking up the definition, finding synonyms, antonyms, writing down ideas
- 10 mins looking for visual inspiration
	- utilized pixels.com and designspiration.com
- Took a wee break
- 10 more mins with the word and writing; filtering what I have written for the things that excite me
- 10 minutes with the images I gathered, pushing them around on the art board; bringing ideas next to one another and consolidating

- Consolidation:
	- Am going to only use shapes
	- Herds and going against the herd
	- Direction:
		- upward spirals
	- Breaking and rebuilding
	- From waste, usefulness
	- rigidity (squares and triangles) and novelty (circles)
### Exploration Phase
- 20 mins drawing on the iPad in GoodNotes utilizing what I came up with in the research phase (no new info!)

## Daily
Hello,

Yesterday:
Created the inspiration collage for Day 83; spent longer on it than I probably should have, but it was fun and helpful
Met up with Derek.
Created some copy for portfolio site.
Read about style tiles and started working on one

Today:
Created the style-tile. Feeling caught up now, which is a good feeling.
Making a graphic out of the secret word. Going to do my best to stick to the time slots. Going to do my best to have fun with this.

Cheers!

## Day 84
[Generic work day](https://perpetual.education/lesson/generic-work-day/)

### Today’s Activities
Answered questions about what my website needs to do, who it is for, what it is for, what it needs to have. 
Spent time gathering some visual, type, and web design inspiration, making notes of what I like and possible
Met up with Derek who helped me clarify who my audience is
Started writing out some copy for the site.
Researched color psychology a little bit and am going to work with the color orange as it is not only a color that evokes enthusiasm, but also simplicity, which matches perfectly with what I am trying to convey.
Got the copy into Affinity and using the Chris Do’s type manual to get me going.

### Daily
Hello,

Weekend:
Got a decent start on my business card site; starting to utilize style tiles while also implementing intentional spacing practices. 
Met up with Derek. He offered feedback and help with the rough draft of the start of my business card site


Today:
Finish up the first two parts of Saturday’s lesson (gathering and writing down what the site needs)
Re-read about style tiles to get a better understanding of how to implement these on the website. 
Flesh the business card site out.
Revisit past projects and see what I can do to gussy them up. 

Cheers 

## Day 83
[DFTW: Visual language and style tiles intro](https://perpetual.education/lesson/visual-language-intro/)

### Copy Ideas
#### Front page
well, hello there! 

i’m chris and i’m a web designer and developer.

i love to work with developers to solve interesting problems related to visual design and web app development

my design and development philosophy is rooted in simplicity and the user experience. for me, this means a site needs to be responsive, accessible, simple, and functional. 

and perhaps even a bit playful too!

i also work hard to ensure the code i write is readable, efficient and as modular as possible.

the tools i use to accomplish the above, for now at least, are HTML, CSS,  PHP, and Javascript.

#### About 
i got started with coding roughly a year ago. i quickly fell in love with it, especially javascript. 

this year has mainly consisted of a lot of learning by doing. 

i started learning about visual midway through the year as a student in the Design For The Web mentorship program.

the project i am most proud of so far is this slideshow code generator. 

it is a tool to help other developers generate the CSS code to implement a slideshow into their own projects. 

the code generated is dependent upon the number of images and how long each image will fade and hold. 

the tool offers a preview of the fade and hold time to make the process user-friendly.

### Brainstorming
* who is my audience?
	* Other web developer teams:
		* web developers who are looking for talent
	* freelancing/client work
		* potential clients, people that are in need of web design and development; people/businesses that need a consistent and intentionally crafted web presence in the form of a website or web app
		* small business owners, agencies, companies
* What does my audience/customers need?
	* Webdevelopers:
		* need to know that I can do the job
		* need to know what languages I am familiar with
	* Understanding in terms of what they are offering to their customers
	* Expertise in translating their brand into design thinking and web development
* what do they need to know about me?
	* [[LFPS - Laser Focused Positioning Statement]] 
	* I am credible
		* type and space
	* That I care.
	* I am capable at giving them what they are looking for
	* How would I convey credibility, care, and capability?
		* projects and case-studies
	* My design and development philosophy
		* User-centric
		* Simple
		* Efficient
		* Responsive
		* Accessible
		* Playful
	* Overview of my process
		* [case-studies](https://perpetual.education/resources/intro-to-case-studies)
	* How to get in touch with me
		* social media icons?
			* LinkedIn
		* email
* what copy would I used to tell them? [[/Copy Ideas]]]
* do I need anything else on the page?
	* Logo
	* Menu for internal links
	* Picture of me?
	* About section (story)
* a little research
* a mood board
* what *mood* / feeling - am I trying to convey visually?
	* Potential Moods:
		* Excitement
		* Enthusiasm
		* Playful
		* personable
* a style-tile / taking that content and dressing it up
* sharing that all with the group

### Daily
Hello,

Yesterday:
Analyzed a couple websites for use of space.

Today:
Made a quick mock up of one of yesterday’s sites that I think is also going to serve as a starting point for my portfolio website. 
Met up with Derek.

Cheers :)

## Day 82
[Research & Employ](https://perpetual.education/lesson/research-and-employ/)

### Site Recreation
I am rebuilding the first site.

Initial unit of space: 16px

I am going to try to make all spaces relative to this. 

Created a CSS Variable for this so that moving forward I can employ the calc() function multiples of this. For example:
`calc(var(--space-unit) / 2)`
`calc(var(--space-unit) * 2)`

As I do the above I realize that it could be helpful to create spatial patterns for margins and paddings, similar to the text styling classes. Something like:
```
--big-margin: calc(var(--space-unit) * 4)
--small-margin: calc(var(--space-unit))
```

I know that relative units do something similar, but I feel, at least for now, that this could give me more control. 

Utilizing type patterns:
- attention-voice

### Methodology for analyzing
Using rectangles to highlight a space.
Using the color of the rectangles to indicate a unique unit of space.
Using staircase stacking of units so that we can see that there are multiples of individual units

### Findings and thoughts during analyzing sites
The first site I analyzed seemed like the spacing was consistent within a component, but not so much across the page. In other words different components seem to have different internal spacings when compared to each other. However this does not impact the readability of the layout negatively, in this case. 

I can tell that a lot of the margins and paddings are relative to font size.

I am finding that it’s interesting to find an obvious space and then see if there are any relationships between that space and other spaces. 

For the second site I analyze I noticed the little margin at the top of the page, made a unit of space out of this and then stacked these to see if multiples of that same space were utilized in other places. 

### Analysis Conclusions
The space within a component doesn’t have to be consistent between different components to work. The navigation spacing doesn’t need to be informed by the spacing I use in a card, or in a hero section, or the footer.

However when there are several of the same type of components, internal space should be consistent. All my card components should have the same spacing. This, to me, is obvious and if one is using modular design, this would be a symptom of that. 

Spacing between components doesn’t necessarily have to be consistent, however the spacing between the same components ought to be consistent. All my cards should have consistent spacing between them. The spacing between the hero section and the header versus the spacing between the hero and the card section doesn’t necessarily have to be consistent. 

Finding a unit of spacing at the start of the project is helpful for making informed decisions.

Font size and the relative em unit can be useful for creating space because they will all be relative to the same initial unit (i.e. the font size).


### Daily
Hello,

Yesterday:
Watched Milka and Chris’ analysis (most of it anyways) and took notes along the way; read Chris’ Typography manual; perused Milka’s site

Today:
Find some website to analyze for use of space; use affinity to help with this analysis.
Mock something out with HTML and CSS using my findings
Go from there

Cheers.

## Day 81
[Contrast](https://perpetual.education/lesson/contrast/)

### Notes on Contrast
See also [[Contrast]]

Start with the Focal Point

The eyes and attention are directed by contrast. Space creates contrast.

Do bad work to discover the good work. What doesn’t work reveals what does work. The contrast between the two reveal each other. 

Type Contrasts:
- font size
- weight
- casing (uppercase and lowercase)
- italicize

### Daily
Yesterday:
Went through the assignment, playing with space and experiencing its power to create contrast and experience. 
Made some progress on the responsive layout challenge
Met up with Derek for a couple hours; we discussed goals; he helped me start putting together a data structure for a project I am working on. Was very fun and helpful and I am grateful.

Today:
Exploring contrast; watching another analysis with Milka and Chris (I really enjoyed the one I watched a few weeks ago; I feel like I learned a lot)
Finish the responsive layout challenge and add it to my projects
Spend some time creating a plan of action for prioritizing and attacking this backlog of things that need to be done (blog/writing, portfolio/business card site which I have yet to even create, sprucing up and finalizing projects I’ve already started during this course, like the business site and others).

Feeling some overwhelm. Wishing for more consolidation days. Enthusiastic nonetheless. 

Cheers!

## Day 80
[Space!!!](https://perpetual.education/lesson/space/)


### Notes
What is space? The relationship between an object and its environment and objects with other objects. 

Space involves alignment, proximity and negative spatial shapes. 

Space directs attention.

Space creates contrast. Contrasting with color, size, style, font. Bringing qualities nearer to or farther from one another generates emergent properties. Hidden and secret qualities get revealed in the juxtaposition.

These emergent properties have psychological impacts: excitement, fear, boredom, interest, aggression, calmness.

These properties also guide attention

Space and proximity reveal relationships.

Qualities that depend on one another for their quality to have meaning:
High - low
Big - small
Loud - quiet
Bright - dim
Full - empty
Hard - soft
Order - chaos
Color - grayscale
Rough - smooth
Close - far
Normal - strange
Round - sharp
Closed - open
Tension - release
Symmetry - asymmetry
Connected - disconnected
Focus - blur

#### Notes from 2nd video
Being thoughtful with how one spaces text. Even if it’s randomly placed, what is driving the placement? How can that placement be unified across the project?

Learning to pay attention to the space, not the content.

—————
The first challenge seems to be bringing things in our visual inspiration folder near one another

The second challenge:
- create a simple website layout
- create some components paying attention to size

### Tasks:
Go to the mood boards and find contrasting items and group these together in interesting ways. Make at least 3 groupings and write out a brief explanation on what decisions were made in choosing each of the groupings. 
Find 3 components and analyze them for space; create these in Affinity designer and make one iteration on each. Perhaps one iteration for mobile screen and one for desktop
Code these out. 

### Daily
Yesterday:
Did some more component analysis in the morning
Got caught up on the assignments; made mood boards; created some black and white and grayscale graphics.
Got started on another responsive challenge (this one). https://perpetual.education/exercise/responsive-layout-challenge-variations/ 

Today:
Meeting up with Derek
Working on today’s assignment
Spend some time with what I have so much resistance to doing, for whatever reason: planning out my public facing site and writing and thinking about my goals. I do have some written out already, but I want to see if I can flesh them out some more, and then start thinking about how to lay them out on a simple site. 
Make some more components. (I am finding this site is awesome for discovering components; I am thinking about doing a daily challenge where I just go through and pick one component to make, then add it to the  Magical Garden of Responsive Layouts and Components. Cue butterflies, sunshine, mist from waterfall and rainbow)

Cheers!
