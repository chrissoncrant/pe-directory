                <h2>End of Course</h2>
                <p>Have enough experience and proof of skill (i.e. legitimate portfolio of legitimate projects with write-ups) to land a job in an entry level position as a web developer/designer. I really don't care where, now is not the time to be choosy. Real world experience is the priority. </p>
                <h2>Within 1-3 Years of Gaining Real World Experience</h2>
                <p>I would like to be working for a company within the climate industry. By this time I would like to be considered a relative expert in Javascript and perhaps the React framework as that is the most widely used frameworks and thus would make me valuable. It's not about politics/ego, it's about the simple reality of the landscape. </p>
                <p>During this time I want to be writing articles more consistently and start making short YouTube videos and tutorials to help others. This is how I would be displaying my expertise.</p>
                <h2>5 Years From Now</h2>
                <p>I am writing my own ticket. I will be working as a senior developer. I will have gained a foothold within the climate sector as a valuable asset in regards to utilizing web technologies to accelerate the cause of climate consciousness and responsible societal action.</p>
                <h2>Other Related Goals</h2>
                <p>I would love to work with developers, engineers, and scientists in constructing collaborative user interface-database systems that are robust and allow for ease of inter-professional collaboration (currently a huge hindrance).</p>
                <p>Working for a cause that is important and with a team of dedicated and inspiring co-workers and friends, building relationships that will last a lifetime.</p>
                <p>Look into getting a degree in Computer Science for the doors it would open and for deeper knowledge of how computers can be leveraged to address climate issues. Plus, quantum computing is fascinating and in order to get into that realm and rub shoulders with those who work in that field would most likely require a degree. Or some good schmoozing capabilities.</p>
                <p>Exploring topics that fascinate me, but currently don't have time for, such as mathematics and physics, and wrapping my learnings within my love of the process of creativity and see how this emerges through music.</p>
