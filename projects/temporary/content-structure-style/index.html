    <p>What follows is based on what I would consider to be the innermost layer, where the content itself (words and
        images) lives.</p>

    <p>But before I get there I think it is helpful to note that in developing a website there are several layers of
        abstraction. For example, there’s the page itself (the outermost layer), then there’s the sections within the
        page (generically we’ll say top section, middle section, bottom section). </p>

    <p>At this level of abstraction perhaps one could consider the sections to be the content within the structure of
        the page. The page would control how each section sits within the page and in relation to one another (i.e. rows
        versus columns)</p>

    <p>Then we step into a section. Now the section becomes the structuring component. For example, all online stores
        that have multiple products will have a products section that contains multiple product cards/items. Each card
        itself (not the words and image within the card, we’re not at that layer yet, but the card itself) could be
        considered the content at this level of abstraction and the section would determine how they are laid out in
        relation to one another.</p>

    <p>Then we step into the actual product card and now we get to the smallest pieces that are actually and
        unequivocally content. In its simplest and least abstracted form content is words, images, and perhaps buttons,
        links, and form inputs (probably others as well). Content at its simplest though is words and images.</p>

    <h2 id="Content">Content</h2>
    <p>Content itself is fully independent upon where it lives and should be able to be reused across multiple areas
        and/or pages of a site. Products on an online store make for an excellent example.</p>

    <p>Every store has products and every product has content that consists, more or less of the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Product name
        </li>
        <li>Product description
        </li>
        <li>Price
        </li>
        <li>Product image(s)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Within this content there is an <i>implied structure</i>, meaning the product name is more important than the
        price, which is arguably more important than the description (maybe, maybe not, but to me this makes sense and I
        am going to roll with it).</p>

    <p>This implied structure is useful, but the context of where the content lives may change the structure in regards
        to the specific HTML tags used.</p>

    <h2 id="Structure">Structure</h2>
    <p>The implied structure of the content informs the more specific structure of the HTML markup. The place would
        determine what tag to use. </p>

    <h3 id="Product Card vs. Product Page">Product Card vs. Product Page</h3>

    <h4 id="In product card:">In product card:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>product name - h3
        </li>
        <li>product price - h4
        </li>
        <li>product description - p
        </li>
        <li>product image - img
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="In product page:">In product page: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>product name - h2 (maybe even h1)
        </li>
        <li>product price - h3 (this would be h2 if product name is within an h1)
        </li>
        <li>product description - p
        </li>
        <li>product image - img
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Style">Style</h2>
    <p>With the basic HTML structure in place we could then take it a step further and add classes to the html tags and
        these classes would then apply styles.</p>

    <p>This is where specificity is helpful. There may be multiple h3 tags on the same page, but the context within
        which each lives may change the styling. </p>

    <p>If one page has product cards with h3s within them, but also has an article that contains h3s itself it wouldn’t
        be helpful if we styled the h3s the same. So we could create a product-card-title class and style that
        differently than the h3 found within the article. </p>

    <p>Then there are other contexts such as product cards versus product pages. Below highlights how the styling could
        very well be dependent upon what HTML tag was used to markup the content. </p>

    <p>I also believe that it within this area (Style) that style tiles are utilized. Specifics of content isn’t
        important, what’s important is what the content is (product name versus product description) as that is what
        informs the styling of that. </p>

    <h3 id="Product Card vs. Product Page">Product Card vs. Product Page</h3>

    <h4 id="In product card:">In product card:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>product name: 36px, bold (this doesn’t care if it’s in an h2 or an h3, this just says how it is going to
            look period)
        </li>
        <li>product price: 36px, bold
        </li>
        <li>product description: 24px, light
        </li>
        <li>product image: 200x200px
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="In product page:">In product page:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>product name: 64px, bold
        </li>
        <li>product price: 52px, bold
        </li>
        <li>product description: 36px, regular
        </li>
        <li>product image: 600x600px
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I feel like the more we get into building webpages, the more evident this becomes. </p>
